//A Handy Calcultor For Simple and Complex Problems
//Made by h!m@nshU 
//All the functions are self-made, though the ready-made functions such as sqrt(), pow(), etc. could have been used
//This code is capable of teaching you basic methods of calculation in C++
//Please note that this code is only for G++.
//You can make your own for other compilers by making a few (or no) changes

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(){			//void return type wouldn't work in G++, you can use void return type if you have Turbo or any such comppiler
	cout<<"= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = Amaz Calculator = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = ="<<endl;	
	return 0;		//returns 0 to terminate the main() function
}
